This is a scratch pad for ideas.
Many of them are too undercooked or broad to be articulated as issues on github.


During execution, the context has no awareness of the current method or the call stack. Knowing these things allows for:
  1.) illegal access checks on fields, right now, no way to tell if the field is in the same class as the current method
  2.) contextualized exception throwing with stack trace


Beef up whitelist:
  many Class.is*

Emulate:
  Ljava/lang/reflect/Method;->invoke(Ljava/lang/Object;[Ljava/lang/Object;)Ljava/lang/Object;
  invoke ourselves or run emulated method


Android class lifecycle initialization
  sometimes it can be assumed onCreate has been called
  or just give a list of methods to be called before whatever else

  java -jar simplify/build/libs/simplify-0.1.0-all.jar -i 7604399 -it 'PornApplication;->i2c1cqop3faop3cdhokggmd97ce\(\)'
  ArrayLists are initialized in onCreate, but since that's not known, everything fails


Emulate / spoof stack traces - requires call stack in context or similar
  new-instance v1, Ljava/lang/Exception;
  invoke-direct {v1}, Ljava/lang/Exception;-><init>()V
  invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/Exception;->getStackTrace()[Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;

  invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;->getMethodName()Ljava/lang/String;
  move-result-object v2
  invoke-direct {v0, v2}, Ljava/lang/StringBuffer;-><init>(Ljava/lang/String;)V
  invoke-virtual {v1}, Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;->getClassName()Ljava/lang/String;

  invoke-static {}, Ljava/lang/Thread;->currentThread()Ljava/lang/Thread;
  move-result-object v2
  invoke-virtual {v2}, Ljava/lang/Thread;->getStackTrace()[Ljava/lang/StackTraceElement;


Fail stories:
  * 6494727's phone/b;->a([Ljava/lang/String;)
    doesn't work and looks like it should
  * inner classes are not always resolved properly, should add tests for this, look at base64$coder
  * methods with arrays, like anything in 8748278, don't optimize correctly

Success stories:
  * java -jar simplify/build/libs/simplify-0.1.0-all.jar -i 6247332 -it 'Configs;-><clinit>'
  * java -Xmx6g -jar simplify/build/libs/simplify-0.1.0-all.jar -i 7958300/smali -it '/smv;'
